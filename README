HI!

To run this game, install at least version 0.8.0 of the LOVE 2D game engine. 

Debian/Ubuntu/Linux Mint, Fedora/Red Hat, SUSE, etc. and users should be able to 
find the 0.8.0 prelease in the package manager under the name 'love-unstable', 
unless 0.8.0 has been released by the time you read this then you should use 
just 'love'. 

If it is not available in your distro's repositories, you can download the 
latest version from http://love2d.org/

If the game doesn't work, your system might have an older version of Love 
preinstalled. Try updating to the latest.
